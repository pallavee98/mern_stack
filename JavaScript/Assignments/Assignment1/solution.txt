 ==> JavaScript is its ability to run directly within web browsers, enabling developers to create client-side functionality. This means JavaScript code is executed on the userâ€™s device rather than on a remote server. This real-time execution contributes to the seamless user experience that modern websites offer.

 Role in web development
 ==========================
 1 Interactivity and user Experience
 JavaScript is primarily responsible for adding interactivity to web pages. It allows developers to create dynamic content that responds to user actions, such as button clicks, form submissions, and mouse movements. Through JavaScript, websites can offer instant feedback, validate user inputs, and provide real-time updates, enhancing overall user experience.

 2 Dom Manipulation
 The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree of objects. JavaScript enables developers to manipulate the DOM, which means they can programmatically modify the content, structure, and style of a web page. This dynamic manipulation is the cornerstone of modern web applications.

 3 Web apis
Web browsers expose a wide range of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) through JavaScript. These APIs provide access to various functionalities, such as manipulating browser history, accessing device hardware (e.g., camera and microphone), and performing geolocation services. By utilizing these APIs, developers can create feature-rich web applications.

JavaScript : JavaScript is a high-level scripting language introduced by Netscape to be run on the client-side of the web browser.
JavaScript is an advanced programming language that makes web pages more interactive and dynamic.
JavaScript simply adds dynamic content to websites to make them look good.
It manipulates content to create dynamic web pages

html: HTML is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.
HTML is a standard markup language that provides the primary structure of a website.
HTML work on the look of the website without the interactive effects and all.

5 primitive data type in java are --- >
string : containg string like "pallavee","1234", "pallavee33"
Number : 23, 5.5 
Boolean : true , false
Null 
Undefines

Using let to declare variables gives them a more specific scope. Variables declared using let are scoped to the block in which they are declared. This is a function with multiple blocks, and it will help show the difference between var and let.

5==>
Single line comments start with //.

Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).

Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.

The importance of variable naming in programming cannot be overstated. Choosing meaningful and descriptive names for variables is essential for several reasons:
Readability and Understandability: Clear and meaningful variable names make your code more readable and understandable. When someone, including yourself, reads the code later on, descriptive variable names make it easier to comprehend the purpose and intent of the variable. It reduces confusion and helps in quickly grasping the logic and flow of the program.
Maintainability and Debugging: Well-named variables facilitate code maintenance and debugging. If you or someone else needs to modify or fix a piece of code, having meaningful variable names makes it easier to identify which variables are involved and their purpose. This speeds up the debugging process and reduces the chances of introducing errors when making changes.
Collaboration and Teamwork: When working in a team environment, using clear and consistent variable naming conventions becomes even more critical.
