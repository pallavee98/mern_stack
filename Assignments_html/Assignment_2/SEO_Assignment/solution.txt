SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” It’s the practice of increasing both the quality and quantity of website traffic, as well as exposure to your brand, through non-paid (also known as "organic") search engine results.
A significant reason that SEO matters is because it helps online publishers appear within the results displayed by search engines. Search engines like Google and Bing each have their own methods of surfacing and formatting the content they display when a user enters a query into a search box
1. Traditional Organic Results

Google’s most familiar results are the traditional organic results, which consist of links to website pages ranked in a particular order based on Google’s algorithms. Search engine algorithms are a set of formulae the search engine uses to determine the relevance of possible results to a user’s query. In the past, Google commonly returned a page of 10 organic results for each query, but now this number can vary widely, and the number of results will differ depending on whether the searcher is using a desktop computer, mobile phone, or other device. Traditional organic results look like this, with each entry having a title, description, link to the source, and other features like dates
2. SERP Features

Beyond the traditional organic results, search engines can surface a variety of other displays which can be categorized under the umbrella term “SERP features”. 
There are also additional SERP features for news results, hotel and travel results, shopping, FAQs, job listings, and more. SEO is important because it influences what search engines surface for all of these results and features.
